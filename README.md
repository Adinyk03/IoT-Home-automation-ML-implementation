# IoT Home Automation System

## Overview

The **IoT Home Automation System** allows remote control of home appliances using the **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module** and **relay modules**. The system integrates **machine learning** to analyze energy consumption and estimate electricity bills. Data is stored in the cloud, and appliances are controlled via a mobile app or web interface.

## Features

- Remote control of appliances using mobile/web interface.
- ESP8266-based Wi-Fi communication.
- Relay control for various appliances.
- Machine learning for energy consumption analysis and bill estimation.
- Cloud storage for data management and real-time monitoring.

## Components

- **Hardware**:
  - ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module
  - 4-Relay Module
  - Optional: Sensors (for additional features)

- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE (for ESP8266 programming)
  - Python (for data analysis and machine learning)
  - Cloud platform (e.g., AWS)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adinyk03/IoT-Home-Automation-System.git
   ```

2. Open the project in **Arduino IDE** and upload the code to the ESP8266.

3. Set up a **cloud platform** for storing and analyzing data.

4. Connect the relay modules and appliances to the ESP8266.

5. Configure the mobile/web interface to control the system.
